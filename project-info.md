**GitHub Issue Summarizer Bot**

**Description:**  
Build a GitHub Action or bot that automatically summarizes new issues in a repository using AI. When someone opens a new issue, the bot comments a concise summary, highlights possible duplicates, and labels the issue based on content.

**Key Features:**
- Uses GitHub Actions or a bot framework.
- Integrates with an NLP API (like OpenAI or Hugging Face) for summarization.
- Checks for similar/duplicate issues using keyword or semantic search.
- Auto-labels issues (e.g., bug, enhancement, question) based on detected intent.
- Optionally, provides a quick reply template for maintainers.

**Why it’s cool:**
- Saves maintainers’ time.
- Helps contributors write clearer issues.
- Great for learning about GitHub APIs, Actions, and NLP.

**Tech Stack:**
- Python
- GitHub Actions or Probot for automation
- OpenAI/Hugging Face for summarization
- ElasticSearch or GitHub’s built-in search for duplicates
